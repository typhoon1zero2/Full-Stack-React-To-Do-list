- Your app should have an input that allows the user to enter a new item to the to do list.
- When the user submits the form (presses enter) the value in the input should be added as an item on your to do list.

# Frontend

`The way this Todo List app works is pretty simple. Type in a task or item or whatever you want into the input field and press Add (+) . Once you've submitted your item, you will see it appear as an entry. You can keep adding item to add additional entries and move the arrow <- ->:`

`To remove an item, just click on an existing entry. It's will show to another page and click the trash-can to removed the item(s). Click Home to return to todo list entry:`
